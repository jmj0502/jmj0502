Welcome to my profile! My name is Jorge Martin Juarez, I'm a full stack developer, who spent most of its time working on backend tasks and trying to build innovativative solutions on its speare time :v:

I'm passionate about technology as a whole, the IT world is evolving everyday and the idea of being part of such evolution process is more than amazing to me. I'm a very proactive person, who's willing to adapt and learn as much as needed, in order to achieve a personal or professional goal.

In recent times I've caught a great interests on low-level development, maybe because I've always been curious about how things work under the surface. I'm also really passionate about programming language design and implementation (I really hope that someday I'm able to make a career out such passion), since such topic allow me to free my creativity and to grow as a problem solver.

I consider myself a team player, since I really love working with a team. I truly consider that team work is one of the best ways to learn and teach concepts related to technology in general; since the different approaches/ideas exposed by each member of a team can be crutial to further develop one skills and to achieve a scalable solution to a certain problem.

If you want to know more about me, feel free to contact me via email!
